WOW Code Exercise
---
This app is a simple Android Studio project which displays fuel station list of NY.

Fork this skeleton project or create your own project to make it complete as follows.

* Implement codes to display fuel station list from the server (URL is in the codes) and detail view as below
* Support orientation changes on Activity without restarting network task (do not use configChanges in the AndroidManifest.xml)
* Implement codes for refresh button, proper title in action bar, home up button, etc
* Download images in an asynchronous way
* Add more test cases for user codes (Use any open source library platform like Robolectric, Espresso, Mockito, etc)

[Optional]
* Implement action menu to sort the data based on brand (BT, shell, etc)
- You may use open source libraries (networking, parser, event, etc) for better app architecture.
- Don't need to make the app look good.

The UI will look like this:
