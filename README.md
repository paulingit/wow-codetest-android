WOW Code Exercise
---
This app is a simple Android Studio project which displays fuel station list of NY.

The skeleton project made for the requirements as follows.

* Implement codes to display fuel station list from the server and detail view as below
* Support orientation changes on Activity without restarting network task (do not use configChanges in the AndroidManifest.xml)
* Implement codes for refresh button, proper title in action bar, home up button, etc
* Download images in an asynchronous way
* Add more test cases for user codes (Use any open source library platform like Robolectric, Espresso, Mockito, etc)
* Implement action menu to sort the data based on brand (BT, shell, etc)

Open source libraries such as volley for networking,
                        Gson for parser,
                        Butterknife for UI have been used for better app architecture.


The UI will look like this:
